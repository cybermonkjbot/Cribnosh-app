How to Store Cards Without Repeated Checkout Screens (Stripe Example)
🔐 Step 1: Use Stripe’s Setup Intents API
This allows you to collect and save a customer’s card details securely without charging them immediately.

You only need to show Stripe’s card input UI once (e.g., during first use or in settings).

The card is securely saved to the user’s Stripe customer object for future use.

🛒 Step 2: Future Payments via Payment Intents
When they place an order:

You create a Payment Intent using the saved card.

The user does not need to re-enter card details or go through the checkout flow again.

This feels “native” and frictionless.

🛠️ Implementation Options
1. Stripe + React Native SDKs
If you're using React Native, Stripe provides a great SDK:

@stripe/stripe-react-native

Lets you save cards using useSetupIntent, and later charge using confirmPayment or server-side intents.

2. Custom Native UI (No Stripe Elements UI)
You can build a custom card entry screen using Stripe’s native SDK or APIs, without showing Stripe’s own UI at all.

Stripe still handles security (PCI compliance) under the hood.

⚠️ Compliance & Safety
This approach is PCI-compliant because Stripe tokenizes the card before sending to your backend.

You never store card numbers directly — Stripe gives you a payment_method_id or customer.id.

🧠 How Bolt/Uber Eats Do It
Apps like Bolt, Uber Eats, and Glovo:

Save cards once using a secure flow (often during first checkout).

Keep those cards on the backend using Stripe, Adyen, or Braintree.

Use silent/auto-charging with saved cards for every future transaction.

TL;DR
Feature	Stripe Setup
Save card without charging	✅ SetupIntent
One-time card entry	✅
Native/custom UI support	✅
Reuse card without Stripe UI	✅
PCI-compliant storage	✅ (handled by Stripe)



You're building a seamless payment system in a React Native food delivery app using Stripe and Convex.

✅ Goal:
Allow users to save their card details once, then silently charge them for future orders without re-entering card details or showing Stripe Checkout again—just like Bolt or Uber Eats.

🔐 Backend (Convex):
- Use Stripe Setup Intents to securely collect and store the user's card (via `payment_method_id`) under their `stripe_customer_id`.
- Save these Stripe IDs to the user's record in Convex (`stripeCustomerId`, `defaultPaymentMethodId`).
- When placing an order, create a Stripe Payment Intent using the saved `payment_method_id` and `customer_id`.

📱 Frontend (React Native):
- Use `@stripe/stripe-react-native` to:
  - Collect card details via `initPaymentSheet` or `useSetupIntent`.
  - Save the `payment_method_id` after user entry.
  - On order placement, call your Convex function that triggers a charge using the saved method.

🛡 Notes:
- Ensure PCI compliance by letting Stripe handle tokenization and storage.
- Don't store raw card details in Convex—only the Stripe tokens/IDs.

🎯 Result:
Users will enter card details once (on first use or settings), and future checkouts will auto-charge their saved card in a native, no-popup, Bolt/Uber-like experience.


Implement a production-grade, frictionless card saving and payment system using Stripe + Convex + React Native.

🔗 Integration Goals:
- Users should enter their card once.
- Future orders should be charged automatically without requiring re-entry of card details or showing Stripe’s hosted UI.
- Ensure PCI compliance by never storing card data directly—only Stripe IDs (customer ID, payment method ID, etc.).

🔒 Backend (Convex):
1. On user signup or card save trigger:
   - Create a Stripe Customer (if not already created) via Convex backend function.
   - Create a SetupIntent using Stripe’s API and return the client_secret to the frontend.

2. On card entry completion (frontend):
   - Receive the payment_method ID from Stripe after confirming SetupIntent.
   - Save the `stripeCustomerId` and `defaultPaymentMethodId` to the user’s Convex doc.

3. On order placement:
   - Create a Stripe PaymentIntent using the saved `payment_method_id` and `customer_id`.
   - Confirm the intent server-side with `off_session: true` and `confirm: true` to enable auto-charging without UI.

📲 Frontend (React Native with @stripe/stripe-react-native):
1. Use Stripe’s `initPaymentSheet` or `useSetupIntent` to present a native card entry screen **only once**.
2. Confirm SetupIntent and extract `paymentMethodId`.
3. Store confirmation on the user doc via Convex mutation.
4. On order, call Convex to silently charge using the saved card.

🔁 Flows:
- 🔄 Save Card Flow (once): Create SetupIntent → Native card input → Confirm → Save method ID.
- 🧾 Charge Flow (repeat): Trigger Convex mutation → Create & confirm PaymentIntent silently → Return success/failure.

⚠️ Compliance & UX:
- All card data must be handled through Stripe elements or SDKs only.
- Use Stripe's off-session flags to support silent charging.
- Implement robust error handling for failed charges or expired cards.

🎯 Deliverable:
A seamless Bolt/Uber Eats-like payment flow: card saved once, all future orders charged instantly and invisibly.
