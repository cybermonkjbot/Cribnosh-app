Core Experience
The Nosh Heaven feature transforms the CribNosh Home screen into an immersive, TikTok-style video browsing experience. It's a hidden, magical interaction that users discover by scrolling to the bottom of the main feed.
üîÑ User Journey Flow
1. Discovery Phase
User scrolls through the main Home feed (Order Again, Cuisines, etc.)
When they reach the bottom of the scroll, a special trigger appears
Message: "Pull Harder to Enter Nosh Heaven üçΩÔ∏è" with progress bar
User must intentionally pull down beyond the scroll limit (90% threshold)
2. Entry Transition
On sufficient pull, the entire screen transitions to Nosh Heaven mode
Main Home feed is replaced with a full-screen video player
Smooth animation with scale/fade effects
